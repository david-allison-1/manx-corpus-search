* Add a summary+context on the main search page for the first few search results for each work
  * Similar to Acrobat Reader
  * I'm not certain I see how this would look, I'll give it a shot, but it might need iteration
* Add an optional "notes" field for each translation - display beside the entity in the "individual work search"

* Obtain Author Types
* Obtain Permission: Max, Chris, Prof.


* General search:
  * Full Text
  * Case Sensitive
  * Diacritics
  * Hyphens!

* Add Analytics - helps justify the effort/cost - Google Analytics is the standard and shouldn't need a GDPR cookie warning if we don't track users between sessions
    * We'll likely want a privacy policy since we're now collecting user data, so this will be lower priority for me

Done (for changelog)
* Diacritics are ignored in the general search
* Change dates to: 1600-current year
* Add buttons for specific date ranges/author types
* The visuals of the site have been improved
* Allow the main search page to be filtered: 
  * Chronological order 
  * Alphabetical
  * A priority order will likely be out of scope unless it can be well-defined.
